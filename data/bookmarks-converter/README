Data here was imported from https://github.com/radam9/bookmarks-converter/tree/main/data

Some of the (chrome-)json files:

  - are in an internal format
  - mix up netscape-html dates and chrome-json dates
  - use ints not strings, which we never see in the wild

These were not imported.

Some of the (netscape-)html files:

  - mix internal dates and netscape-html dates, a factor of 1000000

These were manually fixed and then imported.
